## Local Development

- Uses `yarn` for dependencies. Look at `package.json` for scripts.
- Do not overuse comments. We are senior developers and should write clean code that is self documenting and uses best practices.

## Project Structure

- `src/conduct-ecs/` contains the main Entity Component System (ECS) framework. See `src/conduct-ecs/README.md` for details.
- `src/game/` contains our game-specific code.
- We use WebGl for client-side rendering.
